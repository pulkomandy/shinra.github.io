<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Thomson MO6 is a French 8-bit computer. It's an upgrade of the MO5,
using new gate array technology developped for the TO8. The new gate array
allows more flexible memory mapping and a simpler hardware design, but still
ensures almost full compatibility with the MO5. This machine is not explored
very much, people either prefer the "real" MO5 or the more powerful TO8.</p>

<p>Most (but not all) commercial games worked on both the TO8 and the MO5. As
a result, they often use only the common hardware between the two, missing some
tricks that are only possible on only one of the machines. The MO6 lacks the
timer chip (used for tape drive control on TO8), the keyboard microcontroller
(instead polling the keyboard matrix using the main CPU and system PIA just
like the MO5). It has a software-controlled caps lock led.</p>

<p>The MO6 integrates some of the external hardware of MO5 expansions.
This includes the "Sound and Games" expansion (an extra PIA with two joystick
ports and 6-bit sound output), the tape drive.</p>

<p>The memory gets upgraded as well. The MO6 comes with 128K of RAM, accessible
using various mapping schemes. The first 64K can be used as screen memory pages,
and any part of the memory can be mapped either in "user space" or
"cartridge space". A compatibility mode for the Nanor√©seau is also possible.
The ROM is upgraded as well. Besides the well-known monitor and Basic 1.0 (both
of them are updated to configure the MO6 gate array at boot to be in MO5 
compatible mode), there's an imporved BASIC 128 which integrates "Disk Basic"
extensions from the MO5 and allows use of the full 128K of memory. The MO6 also
gets a boot screen where you can pick your BASIC version and set the palette.
The ROM also has the "ExtraMON" extension which add various useful things to
the monitor and syscalls.</p>

<p>Most documentation on the machine is only available as scanned PDF of old
books, and in French. The idea of this page is to sum up all of it in an
accessible format, using hyperlinks, and all that modern webstuff.</p>

<p>This MO6 documentation will not always repeat things that are the same as
on the MO5. Please cross-reference the MO5 guide when in doubt.</p>
