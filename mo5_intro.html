<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Thomson MO5 is a French 8-bit computer. It's quite known there
because it was part of a government plan to put computers in all
schools. The educative software was usually quite bad and made most
French people hate computing. It is quite a limited machine, but
that's what demoing is all about : pushing the limits.</p>

<p>Most documentation on the machine is only available as scanned PDF of old
books, and in French. The idea of this page is to sum up all of it in an
accessible format, using hyperlinks, and all that modern webstuff.</p>
