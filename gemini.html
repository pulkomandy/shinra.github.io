<h1>Gemini - A 1MB RAM expansion for Amstrad Plus</h1>

<h2>Why yet another RAM expansion?</h2>

<p>Lately there has been a large development in hardware for the Amstrad CPC series. This is great!
You now can chose from several design and manufacturers if you are looking for extra hardware for
your machine. I thought I could retire from hardware manufacturing and find better ways to waste my
time. Unfortunately, that time has not come yet, as the existing expansions all had a problem.</p>

<p>The issue is specific to the
Amstrad Plus machines which add yet another complication to the memory mapping handling on CPC
machines. Basically, the ASIC can be memory mapped and hide a part of the RAM. This works well for
the main RAM bank, and on the CPC, it also works for the internal extra 64K of RAM, which can be
mapped at the same address. If you try to map both the RAM and the ASIC there, the ASIC is mapped
and the RAM is not accessible until the ASIC is moved out of the way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, memory expansions designed for the classic CPC does not take this into account.
For some of them, because they were designed before the Amstrad Plus ASIC existed, and for some,
the designers didn't think of it or decided it was not important. As a result, these extensions
can enter in conflict with the ASIC, which will result, at best, in software crashes, and at worst,
in damage to the hardware.</p>

<p>Software that is known to hit this problem with existing memory expansions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=72279">CRTC3 demo</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://soundtrackerdma.cpcscene.net">Soundtracker DMA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The other problem is some expansions use old chips that may be out of production, and, who still
uses DIP through-hole packages in 2022 anyway? In my case I picked much smaller surface mounted
components. Also, all the needed design files are available and the board can be assembled without
expansive hardware. You'll need a GAL programmer if you want to build one yourself, but that's
easy to hand assemble if you don't want to buy one (that's what I did). So this should make sure
this design remains available even when I'm not able to manufacture it anymore.</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>The board uses two ATF22V10 GALs, one mostly replicating the role of the internal PAL in the
classic CPC, and the other reproducing the logic used for the ASIC lock and unlock sequence
(it was almost, but not completely, possible to fit all this in just two chips, unfortunately
some extra glue logic had to be added). The board internally tracks the unlock sequence and the
status of the RMR2 register to know if the ASIC is mapped to the CPU. When that's the case, it will
automatically disable the RAM page that may be accessible at the same address. Gemini also provides
two LEDs to tell you when it thinks the ASIC is unlocked, and mapped into memory. You can watch
these light up and blink as you run software using Plus features.</p>

<p>There is a switch to select if you want to enable the full 1MB of RAM, or, in case some software
has problems with that, restrict it to 512K instead. If that still causes problems and you need
64 or 128K of RAM, just unplug the card from the computer.</p>

<p>This card can also be used on the CPC 6128, but it will still hide one of its pages if some
software attempts to unlock and map the ASIC. It is possible to remove some components from the
board and make a version for the 6128, but maybe you can get one of the existing expansions from
other places instead?</p>

<p>The card is NOT compatible with the CPC 464 and 664. These machines require special handling
due to limitations in their memory mapping support, which I did not want to mess with, in part
because I don't own any of these machines. So, if you have a CPC 464 or CPC 664, <strong>don't buy this
device</strong>. You will find other people who are willing to help you. The 464 Plus has no such
problems, and this card can be used as designed there.</p>

<h2>Where to get it?</h2>

<p>The Gemini is manufactured by PulkoMandy. A board costs 35â‚¬ including worldwide shipping.
Contact me by email to make sure I have boards in stock, and we can arrange payment and shipping.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>For once I don't need to write any software to accompany this hardware! It is compatible with
anything that uses the DKTronics memory expansion scheme as well as the Yarek/RAM7 further extensions
to that to go past the 512K memory limit.</p>

<p>So, you can run SymbOS, FutureOS, ParaDOS, ... and any software that knows how to use all this
RAM. Or write your own. Have fun with it!</p>
